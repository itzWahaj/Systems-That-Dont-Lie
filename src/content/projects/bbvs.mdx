## The Problem
Traditional voting is centralized, slow, and vulnerable to tampering. Single points of failure allow for data manipulation, and manual tallying destroys trust.

## The Solution
BBVS eliminates trust assumptions. By binding identity to biometrics and votes to an immutable ledger, we ensure that **one person = one vote**, and the count is mathematically verifiable.

## The Process
1. **Requirement**: Defined threat model & biometric constraints.
2. **Sprints**: Iterative smart contract development & testing.
3. **Deployment**: Polygon testnet launch & security audit.

## System Architecture
Critical Path: Biometric Registration → Vote Encryption → Automated Tallying.

## Security & Caveats
- **Privacy**: Biometric templates are never stored raw. We store salted hashes using the standard WebAuthn implementation, ensuring that even if the database is leaked, user biometrics remain secure.
- **Threat Model**: We address network congestion via layer-2 batching and Sybil attacks via hardware-backed identity binding.
